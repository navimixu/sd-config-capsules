## What is this

This extension primarily has two objectives:
- To allow the retrieval of generation configurations from online sources (currently civitai, gelbooru, danbooru) and apply them to the WebUI interface with minimal effort.
- To save the current generation configuration from the interface into capsules that can be quickly reapplied when needed.

## Use cases:
- Fetching and remixing images from online sources in WebUI
- Creating templates for different checkpoints
- Quickly cycling between resolutions
- Saving prompts with suitable configurations

## Features

- generation config fetching from ai sites (civitai)

- generation config formulation from booru image boards (gelbooru, danbooru) and with optimal reslutions for SDXL models and tag type filtering 

- config capsules creation and application


## Usage

### Use mode

- In Use Mode, you can either provide the url to image from one of the supported sites and fetch the checked settings

<img  src="screenshots/use.jpg"/>

- or you can use one of your saved config capsules by typing @ then you capsule name exmpale "@my_preset"

<img  src="screenshots/use2.png"/>

(Note you can also tap the Enter key after typing the url or the capsule name to quickly apply all of the settings without filtering any)

- The gallery entries are physically present in `extensions\sd-webui-wildcard-gallery\cards` as acts the same as any extra network entry.

### Edit mode

- In Edit Mode, you can save the selected settings directly from the WebUI interface into a named capsule (stored in userdata/saved_capsules.json). These capsules can later be reapplied when called in Use Mode using the "@" operator.
